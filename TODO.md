- [ ] Cover whole API
  - First priority: `Apps.hs` (OAuth stuff and bearer token) - rename?
    - Will include methods for getting the OAuth credentials & bearer token (see [here](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/docs/Using-the-API/API.md#apps) and [here](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/blob/master/docs/Using-the-API/Testing-with-cURL.md)).
- [ ] Documentation for everything
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Once Apps.hs is implemented, no need to pass in a token.
- [ ] Update cabal file completely and correctly
  - [ ] Version bound dependencies
  - [ ] `other-modules`?
- [ ] Correct JSON deserialization (parse urls and times!)
- [x] Add methods which use Mastodon monad
- [x] Should `AuthClientData (AuthProtect MastodonAuth) = MastodonConfig`? _Answer: **No, for now**_
  - This would mean that we put in the token from the config in mastodonAuth
  - By changing this we change what we need to pass to every method (from token and function to config and function)
  - This would be more flexible in the future if we need to have anything else additional in the config
  - Downsides: could be annoying (having to pass around a dict)?
- [x] Re-exports and the module hierarchy
  - [x] Re-export `Auth` from `API`?
  - [x] ~What to do with `Web.Mastodon`?~ _Answer: **Re-export everything from here**_
  - [x] Naming of functions
    - Conflicts with types record fields
    - General Plan:
      - `-ForUid` suffix for anything which doesn't apply to the current user and takes an id
        - (maybe?) For functions like `follow` and `block`, we could append `-Uid`
        - Accounts -> ForUid, Apps -> Reg, new Actions; move follow/block/etc to Actions
      - (maybe?) `-M` suffix for anything which returns `Mastodon a`
